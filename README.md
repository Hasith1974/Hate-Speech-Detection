# Hate Speech Detection using Machine Learning classification of tweets
Description: Developed a machine learning model to classify tweets as "offensive," "hate speech," or "not hate speech/not offensive" using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The project leverages NLTK for text preprocessing, including tokenization and stopword removal, and employs a Decision Tree Classifier for classification.

## Project Lists
* Description: Here the project tells about the detecting hate speech like classifies the tweets
* Preprocessed text data using NLTK (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization).
* Implemented Decision Tree Classifier for multi-class classification.
* Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
* Applied feature extraction techniques such as TF-IDF and Count Vectorization.
## Features:
1. Tweet Classification Categorize tweets as hate speech or non-hate speech.
2. Pattern Analysis: Examine and learn from textual patterns in tweets associated with hate speech.

## Data Format
* This project accepts the (comma separated values)CSV Files
